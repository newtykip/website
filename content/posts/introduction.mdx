heroAlt: "A cozy Minecraft scene featuring newt sitting on a wooden dock surrounded by glowing lanterns and hanging vines. The area is framed by pink cherry blossom trees and softly lit structures, all beautifully reflected in the calm water below. The atmosphere is warm and peaceful, enhanced by nighttime lighting and shader effects."
